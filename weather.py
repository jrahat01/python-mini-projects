#if not then it will skip down the the else block and print "An error occurred"

    #[0] is the first(and only) item in the dictionary list
    #['description'] pulls the actual weather description

    temperature = data['main']['temp']
    #data['main'] is another dictionary
    #['temp'] gets the actual temperature

#If the API didn't respond with 200 python will run this instead telling the user an error occured.
